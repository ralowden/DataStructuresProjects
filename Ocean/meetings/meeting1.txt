First Meeting 2/21/13

Overall Project is Due: 11:59pm Monday, March 25, 2013
 - So roughly a month, but spring break is in the midst of that as well

Sharing with GitHub and through email
- Brian will come up with a cheat sheet about GitHub for us :)
- Dividing into two groups for now - (Will change later if needed) 
Group I: Part I
	- Ajay
	- Tommy
	- Emilie
	- Brian	
Group II: Part II & Part III 
	- Clayton
	- David
	- Rachel
	- Pat

Code Standards:
 - We will have an interface for each class listing the public methods 
>> reading >> http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html
 - Comments for each method should include:
	- Description of what it does
	- What arguments it takes
	- What it returns 
	- *if you change any of some other person’s code, put a comment by it stating what you changed and why/what it does - just be clear

/* INTERFACE EXAMPLE */
public interface OceanAccess {
	public int width(); // Doesn’t take any arguments, returns an int
	
	public int height();
}

OCEAN CLASS:
public class Ocean implements OceanAccess {
…
…
public int width(){
  return width;
}
public int height(){
  return height;
}
}

To Do List:
- Create project checklist and timeline/due dates
	-Spreadsheet in google doc
- Find more meeting times (doodle poll?)
	-Doodle Poll http://www.doodle.com/x8dh2qe3rskp6mg6
		Times aren’t specific, think of 4 as ‘afternoon’ and 8 as ‘night’
		I guess there are mornings on the weekend but.. I’d rather not
	There's also before lab (although I know Emilie can’t do that always)
- Create Interfaces for project modules (according to groups)
- Understand what Interfaces are
- Understand the different parts of the assignments
- Start learning about GitHub

Next Meeting:
